#What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a git repository allows for changes to be tracked in the direcory 
where initialization took place. This is crucial for making and reviewing 
commits.

#How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area, while holding files that have been modified in a similar 
fashion to a working directory, allows for users of Git to choose which files 
should be included in the next commit. A working directory contains all 
project files, regardless of whether they will be committed. The ability to 
distinguish which files should be committed is very useful because a user 
should always aim to keep the size of his or her commits low.

#How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

The staging area can be used to add singular files to the commit, so that 
large numbers of changes are not being committed at a time.
