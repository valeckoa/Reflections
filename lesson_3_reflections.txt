#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository would be useful when access to one's personal computer is 
limited, or code has to be written away from a workstation. Cloud storage can be 
highly beneficial to diverse development environments.

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is logical to only allow for manual pulling of changes to users' local 
repositories because undesired changes may be made to code stored on GitHub. 
Forcing users to automatically pull all data from GitHub would eliminate the 
purpose of local repositories entirely.

#Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

#What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

#How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

#When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
